#Image Search Microservice

A full stack JavaScript app built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose, with Bootstrap for the (minimal!) front end, and Mocha for testing that fulfills the following user stories:

1. User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.

2. User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.

3. User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

Built for the Image Search Microservice API Project at Free Code Camp. This app uses the Google Custom Search API.

A running version of the app can be found at http://ecc-imagesearch-ms.herokuapp.com/
